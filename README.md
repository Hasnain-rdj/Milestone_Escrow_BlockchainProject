# MilestoneEscrow Smart Contract

A decentralized escrow system for milestone-based freelance payments built on Ethereum. This smart contract enables secure, trustless transactions between clients and freelancers with built-in dispute resolution.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The MilestoneEscrow contract facilitates secure payments for project milestones by holding funds in escrow until deliverables are approved. It includes role-based access control, dispute resolution mechanisms, and comprehensive security features.

### Key Features

- **Milestone-based Payments**: Create and fund individual project milestones
- **Role-based Security**: Separate permissions for Client, Freelancer, and Arbiter
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in arbitration system for contested deliverables
- **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality for contract administration
- **Withdrawal Management**: Secure balance tracking and withdrawal system

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.25
- **License**: MIT
- **Dependencies**: OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard, Ownable
- **Network**: Ethereum-compatible (tested on Remix VM)

## 🚀 Quick Start - Deploy & Test in Remix

### Prerequisites

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Create new file: `contracts/MilestoneEscrow.sol`
3. Copy the contract code from this repository

### Deployment Steps

1. **Compiler Settings**:
   - Select Solidity `0.8.25`
   - Enable optimization (200 runs)
   - Compile the contract

2. **Deploy Contract**:
   - Go to "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
   - Select "Remix VM (Cancun)" environment
   - Set arbiter address (use Account[2])
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Role Addresses** (for testing):
   ```
   Client (Account[0]):     0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4
   Freelancer (Account[1]): 0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2
   Arbiter (Account[2]):    0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Happy Path Testing (5 Steps)

Execute these functions in order using the specified accounts:

1. **createMilestone** (Client - Account[0])
   ```
   freelancer: 0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2
   amount: 100000000000000000 (0.1 ETH in wei)
   deadline: 1761062400 (future timestamp)
   ```

2. **fundMilestone** (Client - Account[0])
   ```
   VALUE: 100000000000000000 wei
   id: 1
   ```

3. **submitDelivery** (Freelancer - Account[1])
   ```
   id: 1
   proof: "ipfs://QmTestDelivery123"
   ```

4. **approveMilestone** (Client - Account[0])
   ```
   id: 1
   ```

5. **withdraw** (Freelancer - Account[1])
   ```
   (no parameters required)
   ```

### Negative Path Testing (Security Validation)

Test these revert scenarios to validate contract security:

1. **Wrong Payment Amount**: Fund with incorrect value → "not fundable"
2. **Unauthorized Submission**: Non-freelancer submits delivery → "only freelancer"
3. **Unauthorized Approval**: Non-client approves milestone → "only client"
4. **Unauthorized Resolution**: Non-arbiter resolves dispute → "only arbiter"
5. **Zero Balance Withdrawal**: Withdraw with no balance → "no balance"

## 📊 Contract Functions

### Core Functions

| Function | Role | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `createMilestone` | Client | Create new milestone with freelancer, amount, and deadline |
| `fundMilestone` | Client | Fund milestone with exact ETH amount |
| `submitDelivery` | Freelancer | Submit delivery proof for milestone |
| `approveMilestone` | Client | Approve delivery and credit freelancer |
| `withdraw` | Freelancer | Withdraw earned payments |

### Administrative Functions

| Function | Role | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `raiseDispute` | Client/Freelancer | Raise dispute for milestone |
| `resolveDispute` | Arbiter | Resolve dispute with payment split |
| `pause`/`unpause` | Owner | Emergency contract controls |
| `setArbiter` | Owner | Update arbiter address |

## 📈 Gas Usage

Transaction gas costs (Remix VM):

| Function | Avg Gas | Type |
|----------|---------|------|
| createMilestone | ~120,000 | Write |
| fundMilestone | ~50,000 | Payable |
| submitDelivery | ~45,000 | Write |
| approveMilestone | ~55,000 | Write |
| withdraw | ~55,000 | Write |

## 🔒 Security Features

- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks on withdraw functions
- **Role-based Access**: Function-level permissions for different user types
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking and state validation
- **Emergency Pause**: Contract can be paused in emergency situations
- **Balance Tracking**: Secure internal balance management

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

This contract addresses key legal challenges in smart contract development:

- **Offer & Acceptance**: Clear milestone creation and approval workflow
- **Translation Risk**: Documented mapping between code and business logic
- **Privacy Protection**: IPFS-based proof storage to avoid on-chain PII
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Educational/demo purpose with compliance disclaimers
- **Contract Ambiguity**: Structured milestone specifications and dispute resolution
