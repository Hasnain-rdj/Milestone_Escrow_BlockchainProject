# MilestoneEscrow Smart Contract

A decentralized escrow system for milestone-based freelance payments built on Ethereum. This smart contract enables secure, trustless transactions between clients and freelancers with built-in dispute resolution.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **MilestoneEscrow** contract facilitates secure payments for project milestones by holding funds in escrow until deliverables are approved. It includes role-based access control, dispute resolution mechanisms, and comprehensive security features.

### Key Features

- **Milestone-based Payments**: Create and fund individual project milestones  
- **Role-based Security**: Separate permissions for Client, Freelancer, and Arbiter  
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in arbitration system for contested deliverables  
- **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality for contract administration  
- **Withdrawal Management**: Secure balance tracking and withdrawal system  

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.25  
- **License**: MIT  
- **Dependencies**: OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard`, `Ownable`  
- **Network**: Ethereum-compatible (tested on Remix VM)  
- **Developer**: Hasnain-rdj  
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-19  

## 🚀 Quick Start - Deploy & Test in Remix

### Prerequisites

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)  
2. Create new file: `contracts/MilestoneEscrow.sol`  
3. Copy the contract code from this repository  

### Deployment Steps

1. **Compiler Settings**  
   - Select Solidity `0.8.25`  
   - Enable optimization (200 runs)  
   - Compile the contract  

2. **Deploy Contract**  
   - Go to **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab  
   - Select environment: `Remix VM (Cancun)`  
   - Set **arbiter address** (use Account[2])  
   - Click **Deploy**  

3. **Role Addresses** (for testing)
```

Client (Account[0]):     0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4
Freelancer (Account[1]): 0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2
Arbiter (Account[2]):    0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db

```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Happy Path Testing (5 Steps)

Execute these functions **in order** using the specified accounts:

1. **createMilestone** (Client - Account[0])  
```

freelancer: 0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2
amount: 100000000000000000 (0.1 ETH in wei)
deadline: 1761062400 (future timestamp)

```

2. **fundMilestone** (Client - Account[0])  
```

VALUE: 100000000000000000 wei
id: 1

```

3. **submitDelivery** (Freelancer - Account[1])  
```

id: 1
proof: "ipfs://QmTestDelivery123"

```

4. **approveMilestone** (Client - Account[0])  
```

id: 1

```

5. **withdraw** (Freelancer - Account[1])  
```

(no parameters required)

```

### Negative Path Testing (Security Validation)

Test these revert scenarios to validate contract security:

1. **Wrong Payment Amount** → “not fundable”  
2. **Unauthorized Submission** → “only freelancer”  
3. **Unauthorized Approval** → “only client”  
4. **Unauthorized Resolution** → “only arbiter”  
5. **Zero Balance Withdrawal** → “no balance”  

## 📊 Contract Functions

### Core Functions

| Function | Role | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `createMilestone` | Client | Create new milestone with freelancer, amount, and deadline |
| `fundMilestone` | Client | Fund milestone with exact ETH amount |
| `submitDelivery` | Freelancer | Submit delivery proof for milestone |
| `approveMilestone` | Client | Approve delivery and credit freelancer |
| `withdraw` | Freelancer | Withdraw earned payments |

### Administrative Functions

| Function | Role | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `raiseDispute` | Client/Freelancer | Raise dispute for milestone |
| `resolveDispute` | Arbiter | Resolve dispute with payment split |
| `pause` / `unpause` | Owner | Emergency contract controls |
| `setArbiter` | Owner | Update arbiter address |

## 📈 Gas Usage

Approximate transaction gas costs (Remix VM):

| Function | Avg Gas | Type |
|-----------|----------|------|
| createMilestone | ~120,000 | Write |
| fundMilestone | ~50,000 | Payable |
| submitDelivery | ~45,000 | Write |
| approveMilestone | ~55,000 | Write |
| withdraw | ~55,000 | Write |

## 🔒 Security Features

- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks on withdraw functions  
- **Role-based Access**: Function-level permissions for different user types  
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking and state validation  
- **Emergency Pause**: Contract can be paused in emergency situations  
- **Balance Tracking**: Secure internal balance management  

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

This contract addresses key legal challenges in smart contract development:

| Legal Issue | Where it appears in your project | Risk (what could go wrong) | Control/Mitigation you will implement |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Offer & Acceptance | `createMilestone` + `approveMilestone` functions | Client may dispute that on-chain approval equals legal contract acceptance; ambiguity over when agreement becomes binding | Include explicit acceptance criteria in milestone description; store reference to off-chain legal agreement; require both parties to acknowledge terms before funding |
| Lost in Translation | Smart contract logic vs. off-chain expectations | Misinterpretation of milestone conditions between parties | Provide clear documentation mapping contract functions to real-world workflows |
| Privacy Protection | IPFS proof submission | Potential exposure of sensitive project data | Store only content hashes (not PII); use IPFS to handle off-chain data |
| Dispute Handling | `resolveDispute` by arbiter | Bias or unfair arbitration outcome | Use neutral arbiter account and transparent on-chain decision logs |
| Contract Ambiguity | Complex milestones | Misunderstanding of terms or deliverables | Standardize milestone templates and specify clear deliverables |
